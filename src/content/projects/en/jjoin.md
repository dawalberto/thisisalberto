## Why?

Let supose that we have to join two excel sheets to get data from both and get a file with the records that match with the condition that we wish. How would you do that?
Nowadays Excel himself has an option to do that but it's not easy to use and let alone intuitive

## What exactly?

Jjoin is a desktop app developed with web technologies.

Consists in three intuitive screens that will guide you through the joining process of the excel sheets:

- In the first screen you will select the files.
- In the second screen you will create the condition to join the files.
- And last you will choose wich fields of both sheets you want to record in the new file. Also you will choose if you want to save only one file with every match and/or to save as many files as matches with the data/fields that you want
