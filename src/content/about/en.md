Hi 👋

My name is Alberto and I'm a Web Developer!

I'm 27 years old and I'm more than 10 years in the IT world of which 8 of them I've been completely focused in the most I like, Web Development.

Among other things, I like it because it implies a constant evolution in terms of knowledge and skills. It seems to me that it is what enriches us as professionals and people.

As a Web Developer I know that the languages and technologies are only the tool and way and not the finish, that's because we should be able to find a solution regardless of them. But although I know this I can't help it feel a special love for JavaScript and the whole new ecosystem that it's growing around him(Node, React, Vue, Angular, etc)

But I don't only enjoy my time being on the computer, I'm a big fan of the sport and I really like to expend time with my friends and family.
