  "description": "I was part of a program called \"Dual Professional Training\", which allows you to carry out twice as many internships as are carried out in\n                        a normal course. This allowed me to complete 400 hours of internships in addition to the 400 that must be done on a mandatory basis. Thanks to this I learned many things before reaching the second year of the higher degree of Development of\n                        Web Applications and I faced it much more prepared and with new points of view and knowledge.\n\n                        All of my efforts and focus during my time at the company were focused on modern JavaScript, Vue.js, and Quasar.\n                        As a web developer, I was part of a project to develop a huge website for the company's labs that currently still in development. My stay there sparked a great interest in me for modern JavaScript and server-side JavaScript.",
