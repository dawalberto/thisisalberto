  "description": "Internships for the intermediate degree of Technician in Microcomputer Systems and Networks lasted 380 hours and although I am currently focused on in web development these internships helped me expand my knowledge in other areas totally different from web development, which has helped me on more than one occasion.\n\n                        The Mobisoft company is a company that developed a software called Glop for hospitality, they have a desktop application that generally installed in POS terminals, they also have an Android version that communicates with the desktop application to make orders. It is designed to facilitate the work of sector employees, being able to manage products, place orders and a wide range of options that accommodate each client.\n\n                        My work in the company as a Technician in Microcomputer Systems and Networks consisted of the installation, configuration and installation of the POS as well as the necessary programs for the final client. I also fixed equipment at the hardware level on some occasions.",
